Hi, my name is Suzanne Flaton and this April I started as a web developement Trainee. During this traineeship I learn how to work with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, NodeJS and ReactJS. You can read all about this in my blog. I will try to post something new regularly.

So, something about me... For one, I am a sports addict. I do triathlons, so I'm always training for that. You might find out that I get a bit cranky when I don't have the time to train, so just know that I will make the time to feed this addiction. I also love snowboarding and had a change to test my brand new board this past February in Austria.
I'm also learning how to be a silver smith. I already made some nice rings and I keep on learning new stuff every time I'm in the workshop. Another big hobby of mine is cooking and baking (and eating it...). I'm always on the lookout for new recipes and new things to try, so if you have something cool that I just have to try, you can always contact me through email or twitter :)
