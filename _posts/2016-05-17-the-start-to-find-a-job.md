After an amazing day friday at Codaisseur with the speeddates with companies, I packed my stuff and went to a nice quiet camping very close to Alkmaar. Just a few moments later al that quiet had completely gone, since we arrived there with 37 children between age 7 and 12! For the second year in a row I worked as a volunteer at Wopsie Topsie Camp. So no sleeping for me this weekend and also no internet, no laptop and no coding, which, I have to admit, felt a little weird. I have been at my laptop coding stuff almost non-stop the last 6 weeks, so 3 whole days without any coding was almost like a detox. But the weekend was lots of fun. The kids were amazing, no sad faces at all, even though is was so very cold. I had such a great time and even though I was glad to sleep in my own bed last night, I also miss the camp and the people who were there!
Anyway, now I'm home again and it's time to start looking for jobs, time to send emails to the companies that I liked during the speeddate session and time to update my resum√©. In short, ignore that I'm exhausted and still a little distracted because of all the fun and start working like nothing happened this weekend... :p
