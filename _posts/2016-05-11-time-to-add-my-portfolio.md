So.... This friday is an important day! Not only is it the day of my final evaluation at Codaisseur Academy, but also a day where I'm going to meet a lot of possible future employers. So it's about time I put some projects in my portfolio. I created a page in this blog with some of the projects that I made during the traineeship. Right now it's only the code, but I'm working on a way to deploy my apps to the internet so the demo button works. When it's finished, it will be awesome!
